 GRS Specs
===========

Each branch contains the files necessary for building a particular GRS
(Gentoo Refence System). See the following for more info:

* `GRS Project`_ page
* `GRS specs`_ repo (upstream)

.. _GRS Project: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:RelEng_GRS
.. _GRS specs: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/grs.git/

Most of the branches here are somewhat crufty, but there should be some new
ones Coming Soon.
